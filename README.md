# Full Stack Engineer Challenge ‚Äì Payload CMS + Lexical Editor

This repository contains my solution to the Full Stack Engineer Challenge. The objective was to integrate [Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com/) with the new [Lexical Editor](https://payloadcms.com/docs/rich-text/lexical), and implement two custom rich text features: a `<mark>` highlighting tool and a footnote system.

## üöÄ Steps Completed

### ‚úÖ Step 1: GitHub Repository

- Created a public GitHub repository to track progress.
- All changes are committed incrementally with meaningful commit messages.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Payload CMS Setup

- Initialized a Payload CMS project using the blank template.
- Connected to a local MongoDB instance.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Lexical Editor Integration

- Configured Payload to use the Lexical rich text editor by modifying `payload.config.ts`.

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Posts Collection

- Created a `posts` collection with the following fields:
  - `title`: plain text
  - `content`: rich text (Lexical Editor)

### ‚úÖ Step 5: `<mark>` Custom Feature

- Added a custom `<mark>` feature to the Lexical editor.
- **Features:**
  - Button placed between _strikethrough_ and _subscript_
  - Uses FontAwesome `faHighlighter` icon
  - Can wrap/unwrap selected text with `<mark>` tags
  - Selection remains active after applying the mark
  - Marked content is parsed to `<mark>` in HTML output

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Footnote Custom Feature

- Replaced the default _superscript_ functionality with a footnote feature.
- Removed the _subscript_ button entirely.
- **Features:**
  - Inserts numbered `<sup>` node for footnotes
  - Opens drawer to input rich text (only: paragraph, bold, italic, strikethrough, links)
  - Previews content when the footnote is selected
  - Allows editing/removing footnotes
  - Converts to `<sup>` + `<footer><ul><li>...</li></ul></footer>` in HTML
